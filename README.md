## Description

- While loop is very efficient, moving away from using variables to save the game state
- The computer is the dealer
- Rounds can be repeated
- No money is involved
- The rules of blackjack are applied here
- Functions carry out specific roles
- Used random and Turtle for clear()
- Commented on functions with triple double quotations for annotating function roles
## What I learnt

- Debugging using StackOverflow and Google ✅
- While loop being efficient ✅
- Function annotating ✅
- Random method usages ✅
- Efficient uses of the for loop ✅
- Keep the game going on forever ✅
## How To Use

- Type y or n to start a game, this is reoccuring after and before a game. 
- Then play a normal game of Blackjack, assuming you are familiar with the game.
- There is no catch for errors, so the application might break if there are any misinputs
